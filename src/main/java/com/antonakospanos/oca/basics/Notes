- JRE executables

1) java: java application executor which is associated with a console to display output/errors
2) javaw: (java windowed) application executor not associated with console. So no display of output/errors. Can be used to silently push the output/errors to text files. Mostly used to launch GUI based application
3) javaws: (java web start) to download and run the distributed web applications. again No console is associated.

All are part of JRE and use same JVM
